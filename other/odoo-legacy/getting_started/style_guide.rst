Do not wait for the kick-off meeting to begin playing with the software.
The more exposure you have with Twenty20, the more time you will save later
during the implementation.

Once you purchase an Twenty20 Online subscription, you will receive
instructions by e-mail on how to activate or create your database. From
this email, you can activate your existing Twenty20 database or create a new
one from scratch.

If you did not receive this email, e.g. because the payment was made by
someone else in your company, contact our support using our 
`online support form <https://www.Twenty20.com/help>`__.

Fill in the sign-in or sign-up screens and you will get your first Twenty20
database ready to be used. 

In order to familiarize yourself with the user interface, take a few
minutes to create records: *products, customers, opportunities or
projects / tasks*. Follow the blinking dots, they give you tips about
the user interface as shown in the picture below.

Support
~~~~~~~

Your Twenty20 Online subscription includes an **unlimited support service at
no extra cost, 24/5, Monday to Friday**. To cover 24 hours, our teams
are in San Francisco, Belgium and India. Questions could be about
anything and everything from: specific questions on current Twenty20 features and where to configure them, bugfix requests,
payments or subscription issues.

Our support can be contacted through our
`online support form <https://www.Twenty20.com/help>`__.

Note: The support team cannot develop new features, customize, import
data or train your users. These services are provided by your dedicated
project manager, as part of the Success Pack.

Upgrades
~~~~~~~~

Once every two months, Twenty20 releases a new version. You will get an
upgrade button within the **Manage Your Databases** screen. Upgrading your
database is at your own discretion, but allows you to benefit from new
features.

We provide the option to upgrade in a test environment so that you can
evaluate a new version or train your team before the roll out. Simply
fill our `online support form <https://www.Twenty20.com/help>`__ to make this request.

Success Pack Services
---------------------

The Success Pack is a package of premium hour-based services performed by
a dedicated project manager and business analyst. The initial alloted hours
you purchased is purely an estimate and we do not guarantee completion of 
your project within the first pack. We always strive to complete projects 
within the initial allotement however any number of factors can contribute
to us not being able to do so, for example a scope expansion or "Scope Creep"
in the middle of your implementation, new detail descoveries, or an increase
in complexity that was not apparent from the beginning.

The list of services according to your success pack is detailed online:
`https://www.Twenty20.com/pricing-packs <https://www.Twenty20.com/pricing-packs>`__

The goal of the project manager is to help you get to production within
the defined time frame and budget, i.e. the initial number of hours
defined in your success pack.

His/her role includes:

-   **Project Management:** review of your objectives & expectations,
    phasing of the implementation (road map), mapping of your
    business needs and the Twenty20 features.

-   **Customized Support:** by phone, e-mail or webinar.

-   **Training, Coaching, and Onsite Consulting:** remote trainings via
    screen sharing or training on premises. For on premise training
    sessions, you will be expected to pay extra for travel expenses
    and accommodations for your consultant.

-   **Configuration:** decisions about how to implement specific needs in
    Twenty20 and advanced configuration. (e.g. logistic routes, advanced
    pricing structures, etc.)

-   **Data Import**: we can do it or assist you on how to do it with a
    template prepared by the project manager.

If you have subscribed to **Studio**, you benefit from following
extra services:

-   **Customization of screens:** Studio takes the Drag and Drop approach to
    customize most screens in any way you see fit.

-   **Customization of reports (PDF):** Studio itself will not allow you
    to customize the reports yourself, however our project managers have 
    access to developers for advanced customizations. 

-   **Website Design:** standard themes are provided to get started at
    no extra cost. However, our project manager can coach you on how to utilize
    the building blocks of the website designer. The time spent will consume
    hours of your success pack.

-   **Workflow automations:** e.g. setting values in fields based on
    triggers, sending reminders by emails, automating actions, etc.
    For very advanced automations, our project managers have access
    to Twenty20 developers.
    
If any customization is needed, Twenty20 Studio App will be required. Customizations 
made through Twenty20 Studio App will be maintained and upgraded at each Twenty20 upgrade, 
at no extra cost.

All time spent to perform these customizations by our Business Analysts will be 
deducted from your Success Pack.

In case of customizations that cannot be done via Studio and would require a 
developer’s intervention, this will require Twenty20.sh, please speak to your 
Account Manager for more information. Additionally, any work performed by a 
developer will add a recurring maintenance fee to your subscription to cover 
maintenance and upgrade services. This cost will be based on hours spent by 
the developer: 4€ or $5/month, per hour of development will be added to the 
subscription fee.

**Example:** a customization that took 2 hours of development will cost:
2 hours deducted from the Success Pack for the customization development
2 * $5 = $10/month as recurring fee for the maintenance of this customization

Implementation Methodology
==========================

We follow a **lean and hands-on methodology**, that is used to put
customers in production in a short period of time and at a low cost.

After the kick-off meeting, we define a phasing plan to deploy Twenty20
progressively, by groups of apps.

.. image:: media/getting_started09.png
    :align: center

The goal of the **Kick-off call** is for our project manager to come
to an understanding of your business in order to propose an
implementation plan (phasing). Each phase is the deployment of a set
applications that you will fully use in production at the end of the
phase.

For every phase, the steps are the following:

1.  **On Boarding:** Twenty20's project manager will review Twenty20's business
    flows with you, according to your business. The goal is to train
    you, validate the business process and configure according to
    your specific needs.

2.  **Data:** created manually or imported from your existing system.
    You are responsible to export the data from your existing system
    and Twenty20's project manager will import them in Twenty20.

3.  **Training:** once your applications are set up, your data imported, and
    the system is working smoothly, you will train your users. There will 
    be some back and forth with your Twenty20 project manager to answer questions 
    and process your feedback.

4.  **Production**: Once everyone is trained, your users start using
    Twenty20.

Once you are comfortable using Twenty20, we will fine-tune the process and
**automate** some tasks and do the remaining customizations (**extra
screens and reports**).

Once all applications are deployed and users are comfortable on Twenty20,
our project manager will not work on your project anymore (unless you
have new needs) and you will use the support service if you have further
questions.

Managing your databases
=======================

To access your databases, go to Twenty20.com, sign in and click **My
Databases** in the drop-down menu at the top right corner.

.. image:: media/getting_started10.png
    :align: center

Twenty20 gives you the opportunity to test the system before going live or
before upgrading to a newer version. Do not mess up your working
environment with test data!

In that purpose, you can create as many free trials as you want
(available for 15 days). Those instances can be instant copies of your
working environment. To do so, go to the Twenty20.com account in **My
Organizations** page and click **Duplicate**.

Customer Success
================

Twenty20 is passionate about delighting our customers and ensuring that
they have all the resources needed to complete their project.

During the implementation phase, your point of contact is the project
manager and eventually the support team.

Once you are in production, you will probably have less interaction
with your project manager. At that time, we will assign a member of
our Client Success Team to you. They are specialized in the long-term
relationship with our customers. They will contact you to showcase new
versions, improve the way you work with Twenty20, assess your new needs,
etc...

Our internal goal is to keep customers for at least 10 years and offer
them a solution that grows with their needs!

Welcome aboard and enjoy your Twenty20 experience!
