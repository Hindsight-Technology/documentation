database to another.

6.2. PASSWORDS.
-------------------
Customer passwords are protected with industry-standard PBKDF2+SHA512 encryption (salted + stretched for thousands of
rounds). Company does not have access to your passwords, and cannot retrieve it for you, the only option if you lose
it is to reset it. Login credentials are always transmitted securely over HTTPS. The Software is also equipped with
password rules that allow the Customer to enforce strong passwords, as well as the ability to use 2FA
(Two factor Authentication) where the user would be required to login with a username and password and then be further
autheniticated with Google Authentication app.  The use of these features are at the discretion of the Customer. Company
is not liable for any issues resulting from poorly protected Customer passwords.

6.3. COMPANY ACCESS.
---------------------
Company helpdesk staff may signin to your account to access settings and information related to your support issue.
For this, they use their own special staff credentials, not your password (which they have no way to know). This special
staff access improves efficiency and security: they can immediately reproduce the problem you are seeing, you never need
to share your password, and we can audit and control staff actions separately! Our Helpdesk staff strives to respect
your privacy as much as possible, and only access files and settings needed to diagnose and resolve your issue Physical
Security. All Company access required 2FA authentication to protect the Customer data.

6.4. SYSTEM SECURITY.
---------------------
All web connections to client instances are protected with state-of-the-art 256-bit SSL encryption.
All our SSL certificates use robust 2048-bit modulus with full SHA-2 certificates chains. Our servers are kept in the
Google data centers under a strict security watch, and patched against the latest SSL vulnerabilities as we are made
aware of them. All Company online servers are running hardened Linux distributions with up-to-date security patches.
Installations are ad-hoc and minimal to limit the number of services that could contain vulnerabilities. Only a few
trusted Company engineers have clearance to remotely manage the servers - and access is only possible using SSH
key pairs (password authentication disallowed). Firewalls and intrusion counter-measures help prevent unauthorized access.
Automatic Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation is implemented in US data centers.
