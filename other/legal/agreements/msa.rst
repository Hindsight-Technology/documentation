access to the Services until Customer conforms its use to the contractual limit and/or to charge the Customer for overages.

3.3. FEES.

(i) fees are based on number of Authorized User subscriptions and product level, (ii) payment obligations are non-cancelable,

3.4. INVOICING AND PAYMENT.
-----------------------------
Customer will provide Company with valid and updated credit card information, or with a valid purchase order or
alternative document reasonably acceptable to Company. If Customer provides credit card information to Company,
Customer authorizes Company to charge such credit card for all purchased Services listed in the Order Form for the
subscription term and any renewal subscription term(s) as set forth in Section 4.2 (Term of Purchased Subscriptions).
Such charges shall be made in advance, either annually or in accordance with any different billing frequency stated in the applicable Order Form.
If the Order Form specifies that payment will be by a method other than a credit card, Company will invoice Customer in
advance and otherwise in accordance with the relevant Order Form. Unless otherwise stated in the Order Form,
invoiced charges are due net twenty-five (25) days from the invoice date. Customers are responsible for providing complete
and accurate billing and contact information to Company and notifying Company of any changes to such information.

3.5. OVERDUE CHARGES.
------------------------
If any invoiced amount is not received by Company by the due date, then without limiting Company’s rights or remedies,
(a) Company may charge Customer late interest fees at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum
rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, and/or (b) Company may condition future subscription renewals and Order Forms on
payment terms shorter than those specified in Section 3.4 (Invoicing and Payment).

3.6. SUSPENSION OF SERVICE AND ACCELERATION.
--------------------------------------------
If any amount owing by Customer under this or any other agreement for Services is thirty (30) or more calendar days overdue
(or ten (10) or more calendar days overdue in the case of amounts Customer have authorized Company to charge to Customer’s credit card),
Company may, without limiting Company other rights and remedies, accelerate Customer’s unpaid fee obligations under such
agreements so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspend Services to Customer until such amounts are paid in full.
Company will provide at least five (5) business days advance notice prior to suspending a Customer account.

3.7. PAYMENT DISPUTES.
---------------------------
Company will not exercise Company rights under Section 3.5 (Overdue Charges) or 3.6 (Suspension of Service and Acceleration)
above if Customer is disputing the applicable charges reasonably and in good faith and is cooperating diligently with Company to resolve the dispute.

3.8. TAXES.
----------------
Company subscription fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature,
including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable against Customer and its Authorized Users
by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, “Taxes”). Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with
Customer’s purchases hereunder. If Company has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is
responsible under this Section 3.8, Company will invoice Customer and Customer will pay that amount unless Customer provides
Company with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.

3.9. FUTURE FUNCTIONALITY.
--------------------------------
Customer agrees that Customer’s purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features, or
dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Company regarding future functionality or features.

4. TERM; TERMINATION.
========================

4.1. TERM OF AGREEMENT.
----------------------------
This Agreement commences on the date Customer executes it unless otherwise specified in writing on the Order form and,
unless otherwise terminated as specified in the General Terms,
continues until all subscriptions under an applicable Order Form hereunder have expired or have been terminated.

4.2. TERM OF PURCHASED SUBSCRIPTIONS.
-------------------------------------
The Service Term of each subscription shall be as specified in the applicable Order Form.
Except as otherwise specified in an Order Form, the then-current number of subscriptions (including any add-ons) will
automatically renew at Company’s then-current rates as published on https://www.Twenty20.com/pricing,
for additional periods equal to the expiring subscription term or one year (whichever is shorter),
unless either party gives the other notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) calendar days before the end of the
relevant subscription Service Term.

4.3. RIGHTS UPON TERMINATION.
-------------------------------
Other than in connection with a termination by Customer under Section 20.1 of the General Terms, if Customer elects to
terminate its subscriptions or cancel its account prior to the end of its then-effective subscription term
(A) Company will not provide any refund or credit for subscription charges or other fees or payments to Customer; and
(B) in addition to other amounts Customer may owe to Company, Customer must immediately pay any then-unpaid subscription
charges associated with the remainder of each applicable subscription term. If, however, Customer terminates this
Agreement under Section 20.1 of the General Terms, Company will refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder
of the term of all Order Forms after the effective date of termination. Conversely, if this Agreement is terminated by
Company under Section 20.2 of the General Terms, Customer will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all Order Forms.
In no event will termination relieve Customer of Customer’s obligation to pay any fees payable to Company for the period
prior to the effective date of termination.

4.4. EFFECT OF TERMINATION.
-----------------------------
Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, all subscriptions and licenses granted by Company under this Agreement
and Company’s obligation to provide (and Customer’s right to access and use) the Service will terminate.
