4.2 Support Service
-------------------

Support Scope
+++++++++++++

For the duration of this Agreement, Hindsight offers a support service, with an unlimited number of
tickets for bugs. This support service does not include support to customize the Software, develop new modules, or
perform specific actions on your database on your behalf. (e.g. recording data, or configuring the system for you).
Those services may be included in the Investment Summary or offered as an extra through our professional services group
and quoted independently of the Software Agreement.

Support Service Support issues should be submitted online on https://twenty20.io/help. or by email to support@twenty20.io
In case of emergency, you can call our support teams directly for a real-time answer by calling 562-285-9991.

during normal business hours 8am - 5pm Arizona time Monday - Friday excluding legal holidays in the respective countries.

Ninty-five percent  (95%) of the tickets are qualified within 2 business days, and 90% of the critical bugs
(when a user can not work on the system anymore) are processed within 2 hours and resolved in 24 hours.



4.3 Security
------------------------

**Database Security.** Customer data is stored in a dedicated database - no sharing of data between clients.
Data access control rules implement complete isolation between customer databases running on the same cluster,
no access is possible from one database to another.

**Password Security.** Customer passwords are protected with industry-standard
PBKDF2+SHA512 encryption (salted + stretched for thousands of rounds). Hindsight staff does not have access to your
password, and cannot retrieve it for you, the only option if you lose it is to reset it. Login credentials are always
transmitted securely over HTTPS. The Software is also equipped with password rules that allow the Customer to enforce
strong passwords, as well as the ability to use 2FA (Two factor Authentication) where the user would be required to login
with a username and password and then be further autheniticated with Google Authentication app.  The use of these
features are at the discretion of the Customer. Hindsight is not liable for any issues resulting from poorly protected
Customer passwords.

**System Security**. All web connections to client instances are protected with state-of-the-art 256-bit SSL encryption.
All our SSL certificates use robust 2048-bit modulus with full SHA-2 certificates chains. Our servers are kept in the
Google data centers under a strict security watch, and patched against the latest SSL vulnerabilities as we are made
aware of them. All Hindsight online servers are running hardened Linux distributions with up-to-date security patches.
Installations are ad-hoc and minimal to limit the number of services that could contain vulnerabilities. Only a few
trusted Hindsight engineers have clearance to remotely manage the servers - and access is only possible using SSH
key pairs (password authentication disallowed). Firewalls and intrusion counter-measures help prevent unauthorized access.
Automatic Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation is implemented in US data centers. 

**Staff Access.**  Hindsight Helpdesk staff may sign into your account to access settings related to your support issue.
For this, they use their own special staff credentials, not your password (which they have no way to know). This special
staff access improves efficiency and security: they can immediately reproduce the problem you are seeing, you never need
to share your password, and we can audit and control staff actions separately! Our Helpdesk staff strives to respect
your privacy as much as possible, and only access files and settings needed to diagnose and resolve your issue Physical
Security.
