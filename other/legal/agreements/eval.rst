the color. For each contact, I have a form view where I can 
access to all necessary information about the contact. I see 
here my opportunity Macy's has an estimated revenue of $50,000 
and a success rate of 10%. I need to discuss about this 
partnership, so I will schedule a meeting straight from the 
contact form: Macy's partnership meeting. It's super easy 
to create a new meeting with any contact. I can as well send 
an email straight from the opportunity form and the answer 
from the prospect will simply pop up in the system too. Now, 
let's assume that the meeting took place, therefore I can 
mark it as done. And the system automatically suggests a 
next activity. Actually, we configured Twenty20 with a set of
typical activities we follow for every opportunity, and it's 
great to have a thorough followup. The next activity will 
be a follow-up email. Browsing from one screen to the other 
is really simple and adapting to the view too! I can see my 
opportunitities as a to-do list of next activities for example.

With Twenty20 CRM I have a sales management tool that is really
efficient and me and my team can be well organized. I have 
a clear overview of my sales pipeline, meetings, revenues, 
and more.

I go back to my pipeline. Macy's got qualified successfully, 
which mean I can move their file to the next step and I will 
dapt the expected revenue as discussed. Once I have performed 
the qualification process, I will create a new quotation 
based on the feedback I received from my contact. For my 
existing customers, I can as well quickly discover the activity 
around them for any Twenty20 module I use, and continue to
discuss about them. It's that simple.

We have seen how I can manage my daily job as business 
manager or salesperson. At the end of the journey I would 
like to have a concrete view of my customer relationships
and expected revenues. If I go into the reports in Twenty20
CRM, I have the possibility to know exactly what's the 
evolution of the leads over the past months, or have a look 
at the potential revenues and the performance of the 
different teams in terms of conversions from leads to 
opportunities for instance. So with Twenty20 I can have a
clear reporting of every activity based on predefined 
metrics or favorites. I can search for other filters 
too and adapt the view. If I want to go in the details, 
I choose the list view and can click on any item

Twenty20 CRM is not only a powerful tool to achieve our sales
goals with structured activities, performance dashboard, 
next acitivities and more, but also allows me to:

-   Use leads to get in the system unqualified but targeted 
    contacts I may have gathered in a conference or through 
    a contact form on my website. Those leads can then be 
    converted into opportunities.

-   Manage phone calls from Twenty20 CRM by using the VoIP app.
    Call customers, manage a call queue, log calls, schedule 
    calls and next actions to perform.

-   Integrate with Twenty20 Sales to create beautiful online or
    PDF quotations and turn them into sales orders.

-   Use email marketing for marketing campaigns to my customers 
    and prospects.

-   Manage my business seamlessly, even on the go. Indeed, 
    Twenty20 offers a mobile app that lets every business
    organize key sales activities from leads to quotes.

Twenty20 CRM is a powerful, yet easy-to-use app. I firstly used
the sales planner to clearly state my objectives and set up 
our CRM. It will help you getting started quickly too.
