Welcome to the website of Hindsight Technologies, Inc. (collectively with any subsidiaries and affiliates, "Hindsight", "Company", “Twenty20”,”we", "us", or "our"). We have prepared this Privacy Notice ("Privacy Notice") to explain how we collect, use, protect, and disclose your information when you use (1) the Twenty20 website https://twenty20.io or any other Hindsight websites on which this Privacy Notice appears ("Sites"), or (2) Hindsight’s software-as-a-service products, including the software available to you through our platform and any software, mobile applications, products, devices, or other services offered by Hindsight from time to time (collectively, "Twenty20 Platform"). It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal information. "You" refers to you as a visitor or a user of the Sites or the Twenty20 Platform.
This Privacy Notice applies to the Personal Information we collect and use as a data controller. For much of the Personal Information we collect and process through the Twenty20 Platform, we act as a processor/service provider and will only process such information on behalf of and in accordance with the instructions of our customers ("Clients") and their authorized users.

This Privacy Notice also does not apply to third-party software that integrates with the Hindsight Platform.

About Hindsight
================

Hindsight is a leading provider of cloud-based construction management software, headquartered in Arizona, United States, but with offices all around the world. The Twenty20 Platform connects people, applications, and devices and construction firms manage risk and build quality projects safely, on time, and within budget.

Use of the Twenty20 Platform is governed by a separate agreement (“Master Subscription Agreement”) that also covers the use and processing of data provided by Clients and their authorized users, (collectively, “Client Data”), which may include Personal Information. The organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Subscription Agreement with Twenty20 controls their instance of the Twenty20 Platform (their “Instance”) and any associated Client Data. If you have questions about specific Instance settings and privacy practices, please contact the Client whose Instance you are using. If you have received an invitation to join an Instance but have not yet created an account, you should request assistance from the Client that sent the invitation.

Information We Collect
---------------------------
 
We collect information that personally identifies you and other personal information about you or users whose information you provide to us when you sign up for or use the Sites or the Twenty20 Platform (“Personal Information”). Personal Information may include:

Client Data: Clients and authorized users of the Twenty20 Platform with access to a Client’s Instance regularly provide Client Data to Twenty20 pursuant to their Subscription Agreement and as part of their use of the Twenty20 Platform. Twenty20 collects this information under the direction of its Clients and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Client or as otherwise necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Instance Information: When we create/update an Instance, the Client may provide us with account information associated with the Instance, such as email address, business address, phone number, password, domain, and/or similar account details. This information may also include credit card or other financial account information in connection with an order to purchase the Twenty20 Platform. We use this information for account management and billing purposes.

Information You Provide to Us via the Sites: When using the Sites or signing up to use certain areas of the Sites, we may collect and receive the following information from you, including:

- your name, phone number, and other contact details, including the company you work for, for example when filling out a request via the Sites for a demo;

- any other information you may provide to us voluntarily through your use of our Sites.

The decision to provide this information is optional. However, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features accessible via the Sites. Where this is the case, we will make this clear when we ask you to provide the information.

Information from Other Sources: We may receive information about you from other sources, including your company or third parties who are Twenty20 customers/users, and combine this data with information we already have about you. This helps us update, expand, and analyze our records. If others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

In jurisdictions within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and some jurisdictions, this information is considered Personal Information under applicable data protection laws. This type of usage data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor the Twenty20 Platform and the Sites. We may share this usage data with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand our customers’ needs and improve the Twenty20 Platform and the Sites.

Our mobile application for the Twenty20 Platform may collect certain additional information automatically, including the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device’s unique device ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, available storage space, connection type (e.g., WiFi vs. cellular), and information about the way you use the application. We may also use GPS technology (or other similar technology) to determine your current location. If you do not want us to have your location information, you should turn off location services for the mobile application located in your account settings or in your mobile phone settings or within the mobile application.

We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded. We link certain information we store within the analytics software to authorized users for customer usage and metrics, and to aid in customer success.

Who We Share Your Personal Information With
----------------------------------------------
You may make certain of your Personal Information available to others, such as your name or username, for example when you create a profile or submit public queries. This information may be accessed by users who use the Sites or Twenty20 Platform and may be accessed by commercial search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing to the extent that such engines are permitted to access the Sites or Twenty20 Platform.

We may disclose your Personal Information to the following categories of recipients:

- our subsidiaries who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of the Twenty20 Platform);

- co-sponsors of events you attend, or other businesses that we believe to be trustworthy and have privacy practices consistent with ours (“Subprocessors”). For example, we contract with Subprocessors to provide certain services, such as hosting and maintenance, accounting, data analytics, data storage and management, and marketing and promotions, most of which are located in the United States. We only provide our Subprocessors with the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf. Each Subprocessor must agree to use reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information involved, to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Subprocessors are prohibited from using Personal Information other than as specified by Twenty20;

- in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Twenty20 will cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose Personal Information and any other content and information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if, in our discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate in order to respond to or comply with legal requests (including court orders and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property, or rights of Twenty20 or of any third party, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law;

- a potential buyer (and its agents and advisers) in connection with any proposed purchase, merger, or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use your Personal Information only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Notice; and
any other person with your consent to the disclosure.

Be Careful When you Share Information with Others
----------------------------------------------------
Please be aware that whenever you share information on a publicly available page or any other public forum on the Sites or Twenty20 Platform, others may access that information. In addition, please remember that when you share information in any other communications with third parties, that information may be passed along or made public by others. This means that anyone with access to such information can potentially use it for any purpose, including sending unsolicited communications.

Security
----------
At Twenty20, we’re serious about information security, and have implemented numerous security measures to achieve that goal. 

You should be aware that no data transmission over the internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through the Sites or Twenty20 Platform, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit on or through the Sites or Twenty20 Platform, and you do so at your own risk. If you have any questions about the security of your Personal Information, you can contact us using the information provided in the How to Contact Us section below.

Children's Privacy
------------------
We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.

International Data Transfers
------------------------------
Your Personal Information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than the country in which you are a resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective). Specifically, our Sites and Twenty20 Platform are hosted in the United States and our group companies and third-party service providers operate around the world.

However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

Data Retention
---------------
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or where we have an ongoing business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable, legal, tax, or accounting requirements). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we may either delete or deidentify it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

Identifying the Data Controller and Processor/Service Provider
--------------------------------------------------------------
Some jurisdictions differentiate between a “controller” and a “processor”/”service provider” of information. Typically, a Client is the controller of Client Data. Twenty20 is typically the processor/service provider of Client Data (e.g., data provided via the Twenty20 Platform) and the controller of other information (e.g., information provided to us via the Sites).

Individuals who seek access, or who seek to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate Client Data should direct their queries to the Twenty20 Client (the data controller). If you are a customer or employee of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that uses the Twenty20 Platform, please contact the Client that you interact with directly. If our Client requests that Twenty20 remove data we will respond according to appropriate data protection laws.

Your Rights
------------
You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to use some of our features.

Cookies: You can accept or reject cookies for our websites by adjusting your web browser controls.

Marketing Communications: You can opt-out of receiving promotional or marketing communications from us at any time by using the unsubscribe link in the email communications we send or by filling out this Web Form. To opt-out of non-email forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), please contact us using the contact details provided in the How to Contact Us section below. If you set up an account on our Site or for the Twenty20 Platform, we will still send you non-promotional communications like service-related emails.

Upon request Twenty20 will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your Personal Information. You can always review, correct, delete, or update your Personal Information by changing the relevant settings in your Twenty20 account or by emailing us at the address provided below. We will respond to your request at the latest within a month.

California Residents: The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) allows California residents, upon a verifiable consumer request, to request access, in a portable and (if technically feasible) readily usable form, to certain items and categories of Personal Information that we have collected about the consumer, the categories of sources for that information, the business or commercial purposes for collecting the information, and the categories of third parties with which the information was shared. California residents also have the right to submit a request for deletion of information under certain circumstances. Consistent with California law, if you choose to exercise your rights, we won’t treat you negatively for making such a request. If you wish to submit a request, please email us  at privacy@twenty20.io . Please note that you must verify your identity and request before further action is taken. As a part of this process, government identification may be required. Consistent with California law, you may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. In order to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, the requester’s valid government-issued identification, and the authorized agent’s valid government-issued identification.

We do not sell Personal Information to third parties. As described above, we do allow third parties to collect Personal Information through our Sites and share Personal Information with third parties for the business purposes described in this Privacy Notice, including advertising and marketing on our Sites and elsewhere based on users’ online activities over time and across different sites, services, and devices.

Third Party Links
--------------------
Our Sites and Twenty20 Platform may contain links or integrate with other websites and online services, or allow others to send you such links. Twenty20 is not responsible or liable for any damage or loss related to your use of any third-party website or online service. You should always read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of a third-party website or online service before using it, whether directly or in connection with your use of the Sites or the Twenty20 Platform. Third parties may collect, but we do not authorize them to collect, personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Sites or Twenty20 Platform.

Privacy Notice Changes
------------------------
From time to time, we may change this Privacy Notice. When we do, we will take appropriate measures to inform you if necessary, consistent with the significance of the changes we make. For example, we may give you or our Client notice by posting the revised Privacy Notice on the Sites prior to the change becoming effective.

Any changes will go into effect on the effective date shown in the revised Privacy Notice. You can see when this Privacy Notice was last updated by checking the “Effective Date” at the top of this Privacy Notice.
