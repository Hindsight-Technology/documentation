Twenty20 project managment is designed to streamline the information and documents required to manage construction projects of all types.


Twenty20 connects directly to your bank or paypal account. Transactions are synchronized
every hour and reconciliation is blazing fast. It's like magic.

Instantly create invoices and send them with just a click. No need to print them. 

Twenty20 can send them for you by email or regular mail.

Your customers pay online, meaning you get your money right away.

Twenty20 accounting is connected with all Twenty20 our apps such as sale, purchase,
inventory and subscriptions. 

This way, recording vendor invoices is also super quick. Set a vendor, select the purchase
order and Twenty20 fills in everything for you automatically.

Then, just use the SEPA protocol or print checks to pay vendors
in batches.

It's that easy with Twenty20.

Wait, there is more. You will love the Twenty20 reports. From legal statements to
executive summaries, they are fast and dynamic. Use Twenty20's business intelligence feature to navigate
