   Analytic Accounts

     Sometimes called **Cost Accounts**, are
     accounts that are not part of the chart of accounts and that
     allow you to track costs and revenues. Analytic accounts are usually
     grouped by projects, departments, etc. for analysis of a company's 
     expenditures. Every journal item is posted in a regular account 
     in the chart of account and can be posted to an analytic account 
     for the purpose of reporting or analysis.
