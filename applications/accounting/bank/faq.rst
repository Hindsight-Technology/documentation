The **Purchase** application allows you to manage your purchase orders,
incoming products, and vendor invoices all seamlessly in one place.

If you want to set up a vendor invoice control process, the first thing you
need to do is to have purchase data in Twenty20. Knowing what has been
purchased and received is the first step towards understanding your
purchase management processes.

Here is the standard work flow in Twenty20:

1. You begin with a **Request for Quotation (RFQ)** to send out to your
   vendor(s).

2. Once the vendor has accepted the RFQ, confirm the RFQ into a
   **Purchase Order (PO)**.

3. Confirming the PO generates an **Incoming Shipment** if you purchased
   any stockable products.

4. Upon receiving a **Vendor Invoice** from your Vendor, validate the invoice
   with products received in the previous step to ensure accuracy.

This process may be done by three different people within the company,
or only one.
