Deactivated user accounts and accounts used by external people (or systems) who only have limited access to the Software through the portal facilities (known as "Portal Users" or “Collaboration Users”) are not counted as Users

2.3 BUG
--------------------------------------------------
A Bug is considered any failure of the Software that results in a complete stop, error traceback, or security breach, and is not directly caused by a defective installation or configuration. Non-compliance with specifications or requirements will be considered as Bugs at the discretion of Hindsight (typically, when the Software does not produce the results or performance it was designed to produce, or when a country-specific feature does not meet legal accounting requirements anymore).

2.4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
--------------------------------------------------
"Confidential Information" means all information designated as such by either party in writing together with all other information which relates to the business, affairs, products, developments, trade secrets, know-how, personnel, customers and suppliers of either party, or information which may reasonably be regarded as the confidential information of the disclosing party.

================================================
This Software can only be used (executed, modified, executed after modifications) with a valid Software Subscription for the correct number of users.

It is forbidden to publish, distribute, sublicense, or sell copies of the Software or modified copies of the Software, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Hindsight.

4. Services
================================================
4.1 BUG FIXING SERVICE
------------------------------
For the duration of this Agreement, Hindsight commits to making all reasonable efforts to remedy any Bug of the Software submitted by the Customer through the appropriate channel (typically, Hindsight service desk, email address, or website form), and to start handling such Customer submissions within 2 business days. 

4.2 SUPPORT SERVICE
------------------------------
Support Scope. For the duration of this Agreement, Hindsight offers a support service, with an unlimited number of tickets for bugs. This support service does not include support to customize the Software, develop new modules, or perform specific actions on your database on your behalf. (e.g. recording data, or configuring the system for you). Those services may be included in the Investment Summary or offered as an extra through our professional services group and quoted independently of the Software Agreement.

Support Service Support issues should be submitted online on https://twenty20hindsight.com/help. In case of emergency, you can call our support teams directly for a real time answer.

Our support teams are split across 2 continents in India (Ahmedabad) and United States (Arizona and Pennsylvania). Support is offered during normal business hours 8am - 5pm Arizona time Monday - Friday excluding legal holidays in the respective countries.

You will have a dedicated implementation specialist that will be based in the United States and will be your primary contact during the implementation and training phases. After that time, support may be handled by assignment in our help-desk que.

No guarantees are provided on the time to qualify or close a support ticket, it's based on our best efforts. But 95% of the tickets are qualified within 2 open days, and 90% of the critical bugs (when a user can not work on the system anymore) are processed within 2 hours and resolved in 24 hours.

4.3 SECURITY
------------------------------
Database Security. Customer data is stored in a dedicated database - no sharing of data between clients. Data access control rules implement complete isolation between customer databases running on the same cluster, no access is possible from one database to another.

Password Security. Customer passwords are protected with industry-standard PBKDF2+SHA512 encryption (salted + stretched for thousands of rounds). Hindsight staff does not have access to your password, and cannot retrieve it for you, the only option if you lose it is to reset it. Login credentials are always transmitted securely over HTTPS.

System Security. All web connections to client instances are protected with state-of-the-art 256-bit SSL encryption. All our SSL certificates use robust 2048-bit modulus with full SHA-2 certificates chains. Our servers are kept in the Google data centers under a strict security watch, and always patched against the latest SSL vulnerabilities, enjoying Grade A SSL ratings at all times. All Hindsight online servers are running hardened Linux distributions with up-to-date security patches. Installations are ad-hoc and minimal to limit the number of services that could contain vulnerabilities. Only a few trusted Hindsight engineers have clearance to remotely manage the servers - and access is only possible using SSH key pairs (password authentication disallowed). Firewalls and intrusion counter-measures help prevent unauthorized access. Automatic Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation is implemented in US data centers. 

Staff Access.  Hindsight Helpdesk staff may sign into your account to access settings related to your support issue. For this, they use their own special staff credentials, not your password (which they have no way to know). This special staff access improves efficiency and security: they can immediately reproduce the problem you are seeing, you never need to share your password, and we can audit and control staff actions separately! Our Helpdesk staff strives to respect your privacy as much as possible, and only access files and settings needed to diagnose and resolve your issue Physical Security
