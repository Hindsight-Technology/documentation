The "Assets" module allows you to keep track of your fixed assets like
machinery, land and building. The module allows you to generate monthly
depreciation entries automatically, get depreciation board, sell or
dispose assets and perform reports on your company assets.

As an example, you may buy a car for $36,000 (gross value) and you plan
to amortize it over 36 months (3 years). Every months (periodicity),
Twenty20 will create a depreciation entry automatically reducing your assets
value by $1,000 and passing $1,000 as an expense. After 3 years, this
assets accounts for $0 (salvage value) in your balance sheet.

The different types of assets are grouped into "Assets Types" that
describe how to deprecate an asset. Here are two examples of assets
types:

-  Building: 10 years, yearly linear depreciation
-  Car: 5 years, monthly linear depreciation

Once the module is installed, you should see two new menus in the
accounting application:
